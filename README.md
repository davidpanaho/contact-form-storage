# Contact Form Storage

This is a Craft CMS plugin that extends the functionality of Pixel & Tonic's [Contact Form plugin for Craft](https://github.com/craftcms/contact-form/tree/v1) by saving submissions made through the form.

## Prerequisites

- This plugin only currently supports Craft 2.6.* . It doesn't support the beta version of Craft 3.
- You need to install the V1 branch of [Contact Form plugin for Craft](https://github.com/craftcms/contact-form/tree/v1).

## Intalling plugin

1. Download and install [Contact Form plugin for Craft](https://github.com/craftcms/contact-form/tree/v1). Instructions can be found at the link.
2. [Download](https://github.com/davidpanaho/contact-form-storage/archive/master.zip) this repo and place the `contactstorage` folder in the plugins folder of your Craft installation.
3. In the admin area of your site, click on the **Settings** menu item. In the System section, click **Plugins**. Contact storage should be listed in the available plugins. Click the **Install** button. This should automatically enable the plugin too.

## Notes

- This plugin has only been tested with the example form found in the instructions for [Contact Form plugin for Craft](https://github.com/craftcms/contact-form/tree/v1). As the plugin is used for more sites, I will update it to be more robust.
- I will be looking into making this compatible with the Craft 3 beta shortly.
